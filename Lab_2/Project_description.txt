Performance analysis of java collection implementations.

The objec ve of this program is to test the performance of several Java Collec on 
implementa ons for these methods. 

1. "add" a given element to the collec on 
2. check if a collec on "contains" a given element 
3. "remove" a given element from the collec on (if it is present) 
4. "clear" all the elements in the collec on 

Here I analyse above functions based on 2 categories.
    1. java collection interface
    2. java map interface

Under Jaca collection interface I test the performance of following java collection implementations.
    ->HashSet
    ->TreeSet
    ->LinkedHashSet
    ->ArrayList
    ->LinkedList
    ->ArrayDeque
    ->PriorityQueue

Under Java map interface,
    ->HashMap
    ->TreeMap
    ->LinkedHashMap
