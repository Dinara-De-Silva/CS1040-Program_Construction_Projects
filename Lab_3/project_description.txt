The project is based on java IO Operations, Serialization and Exception Handling.

This project involves developing a Point of Sale (POS) system for the Super-Saving supermarket chain. 
The system aims to streamline the billing process by fetching item details (e.g., price, weight/size, 
manufacturing/expiry dates, manufacturer name) based on an item code. The system calculates and applies 
discounts (0-75%) dynamically and generates an itemized bill with details such as the cashier's name, 
branch, customer name (if applicable), item list, total discount, total price, and the date and time of billing.

The system also supports managing pending bills, allowing cashiers to pause and save partially 
completed transactions for customers who need to make adjustments (e.g., weighing fruits/vegetables) and
continue billing other customers in the meantime. It incorporates serialization for saving 
and retrieving these pending bills efficiently.

To enhance usability, the system handles invalid item codes by implementing a custom exception, ItemCodeNotFound. 
This allows cashiers to re-enter the correct item code without disrupting the billing process.
